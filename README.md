## During the development of this project, I encountered a few challenges:

Understanding the syntax and usage of the ternary operator.
Handling different scenarios and conditions for each challenge.
Ensuring the code is readable and maintainable.
Determining the appropriate conditions for each challenge required careful consideration and attention to detail.

## Areas for Improvement

Based on my experience with this project, here are some areas that could be improved:

Adding more error handling for user inputs.
Implementing additional features or challenges to enhance the project's functionality.
Refactoring the code to improve efficiency and readability.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, I learned several valuable lessons:

The ternary operator is a powerful tool for writing concise conditional statements.
I discovered a more concise and efficient way to implement conditional logic compared to traditional if-else statements.
Regular testing and debugging are essential for identifying and resolving issues.
